# Cusom wake-word detection on Android
This thesis will target implementing an Android service for wake word detection based on a compact neural network model trained on a custom dataset. It will involve training a compact TensorFlow model for performing wake word detection on a custom dataset, exporting the model to TensorFlow Lite and building an Android service that performs wake word detection using the TFLite model. Finally, the work will conduct an evaluation of the wake word detection service in terms of accuracy and false positive detection rate.
